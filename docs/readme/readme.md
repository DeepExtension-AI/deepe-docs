## 💡 1. What is DeepExtension?

[DeepExtension](https://deepextension.ai/) is an AI infrastructure platform that helps enterprises easily manage the full lifecycle of large language model (LLM) development — from data preparation to fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment.

Our mission is to make domain-specific AI development **easy to use, highly collaborative, and scalable**, especially for teams lacking AI professionals or computing resources.

Whether you're an AI engineer or a business expert, DeepExtension provides a collaborative environment that leverages modern technologies like **PEFT**, **GRPO**, to help you build high-quality models — all through a modular web interface.
