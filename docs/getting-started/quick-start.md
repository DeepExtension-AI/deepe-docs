# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **DeepExtension** — a unified platform for domain-specific LLM training, evaluation, and deployment.

This quick guide will help you get started — from installation to your first training run — using our no-code, web-based UI.

## Prerequisite: Installation First

Before you can start using DeepExtension, you need to set up the platform. Installation typically requires some development experience.

- Refer to the full [Installation Guide](../developer/install.md) for step-by-step instructions.
- You can install DeepExtension on:

    - Linux or Windows via WSL (with CUDA for GPU training)
    - macOS (with MLX on Apple M-series)
    - Any Linux/macOS environment (in **no-training mode**) for UI exploration and inference only

Once the installation is complete and the Web UI is accessible (default: `http://localhost:88`), you're ready to move forward.

## Your First Training Run

After installation, we recommend starting with a **demo training method**. DeepExtension includes preinstalled training methods depending on your platform.

- See [Quick Start: Run Your First Training](../tutorials/tutorial-quick-start.md) for hands-on instructions.

You'll be guided through:

1. Uploading a sample dataset  
2. Choosing a base model  
3. Launching a training job

All demo training methods come with sample datasets and configurations so you can run a successful training in minutes.

## After Training

Once your training job completes successfully, you can:

- Explore model results in the **Trained Models** tab
- Save or deploy your model for inference
- Run prompt-based evaluations using **DeepPrompt**
- Compare models using the **Model Assessment** module
