# Key Concepts

**DeepExtension** empowers enterprises to build and deploy domain-specific AI‚Äîwithout requiring deep AI expertise or expensive infrastructure. It‚Äôs a web-based platform designed for **collaboration**, **efficiency**, and **accessibility**, making LLM training achievable for everyone.

Whether you're just starting or scaling an AI initiative, DeepExtension brings together **modular infrastructure, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and best-practice-driven onboarding** to get real results‚Äîfast.

## üìå 1. Case-Driven Onboarding & Best Practice Sharing

DeepExtension is not just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a **repository of proven success stories** and ready-to-use templates.

- Learn from **real-world case studies** in **biotech, industrial design, materials science, total synthesis, mathematical programming**, and more
- Start with **predefined workflows** based on best practices
- Reduce trial-and-error and get fast results
- Build confidence across teams‚Äîeven if they‚Äôve never fine-tuned an LLM before

> **DeepExtension is the ideal starting point** for those who find LLM training overwhelming or don‚Äôt know where to begin.

## üß± 2. Web-Based, Modular LLM Platform

Modular building blocks for the entire LLM lifecycle, accessible through a user-friendly interface:

- Web UI for no-code operation
- Developer hooks for training scripts, metrics, adapters
- Modules for data prep, training, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring

---

## üîÅ 3. PEFT First: Big Impact, Small Footprint

DeepExtension emphasizes **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** to support teams with limited compute and resources:

- Techniques like **LoRA**, **Prompt/Prefix Tuning**, and **adapters**
- Also utilize **SFT**, **PPO**, and **GRPO** for broader fine-tuning and alignment needs
- Ideal for quick iterations on domain-specific models
- Extendable to full fine-tuning when needed

---

## üë• 4. Collaborative AI Workspace

DeepExtension is designed for **dual users**:

- **AI Developers** can integrate custom training logic once
- **Business Experts** operate through the web UI, without writing code
- Enables rapid iteration between business insight and technical execution

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Orchestrated Workflows

Enable structured, auditable AI processes from start to finish:

- Dataset ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Deployment
- Fully versioned and reproducible
- Easily trigger small but impactful training upgrades‚Äîsuch as switching to a newer base model, improving data quality/quantity, or testing a new training method‚Äîwith minimal cost and effort
<!-- - GUI-based orchestration with optional CLI or API extensions -->
<!-- - Built-in human-in-the-loop feedback cycles -->

---

## üß© 6. Extensible Architecture

DeepExtension can adapt to your existing environment:

- Plug in your own models, logic, or data connectors
- Add custom evaluation scripts and event listeners
- Flexible deployment options: run on private cloud, on-premise servers, or even local desktops and laptops (ideal for study, prototyping, or small-scale testing)

---

## üîê 7. Enterprise-Ready by Default

Built to meet enterprise IT and MLOps standards:

- **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control)
- **Audit logging** and compliance support
- **GPU-aware scheduling**
- Deployment across **Ubuntu + CUDA**, **macOS**

---

## üåç 8. Multilingual and Team-Oriented

Collaborate across languages and departments:

- UI and documentation in **English**, **German**, and **Chinese**
- Multi-user, multi-project support
- Organization-level controls and visibility

---

## üß≠ 9. Guided AI 
<!-- with GRPO -->

At the core of DeepExtension is **Guided Reinforcement with Prompt Optimization**:

- Optimize model behavior from natural language prompts
- Output structured formats (e.g., JSON) based on business logic
- Use reinforcement-based tuning strategies with reward feedback

---

**DeepExtension is where enterprise AI journeys begin‚Äî**  
**with real use cases, shared success, and built-in guidance for anyone ready to get started.**
