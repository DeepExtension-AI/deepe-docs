# User Management

The **User Management** module in DeepExtension allows administrators to manage team members, control 
project access, and enforce organizational security policies.

---

## Overview

The **User Management** main page lists all registered users within your DeepExtension instance. Each 
user is shown along with:

- Username
- Project ID

This module is essential for multi-user environments, enabling collaboration while maintaining 
security and visibility.

## Add a New User

To create a new user:

1. Click **"Add User"**
2. Enter the new user's:
   - Username
   - Display name
   - **initial password** 

Once created, users can log in and are encouraged to change their password upon first use.

---

## Delete a User

To remove a user account:

- Click **"Delete"** next to the desired user
- This action is immediate and cannot be undone

> Deleting a user does not affect their previously created models, jobs, or datasets — those 
remain in the system.
