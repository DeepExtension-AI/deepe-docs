# Installation Guide

DeepExtension is an enterprise-level AI platform, and while we aim to make setup as easy as possible, some initial configuration is still required. We recommend using Docker-based deployment to leverage the benefits of containerization and cloud-native infrastructure.

---

## Define Installation Directory

Choose a directory as your DeepExtension base folder. We'll refer to this path as `{deepextension_base_dir}` throughout this guide.

- **Recommended path**: `/opt/deepextension`

---

## 1. Prepare the Database

We recommend **not** using Docker to run your PostgreSQL database. Use a local or dedicated database server for better stability.

1. Install a local PostgreSQL server (version 16 is known to run stably)
2. Make sure to note down the following parameters for later use: {dbname}, {dbuser}, {dbpassword}, {dbhost}, and {dbport}.
3. Initialize the database schema using the **golang-migrate** tool:

### 1.4.1 Install golang-migrate

You can install this tool via CLI or Homebrew (for macOS users):

#### Option A: CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Navigate to the migrate folder in the DeepExtension codebase
cd {deepextension_base_dir}/migrate

# 2. Make the installation script executable
chmod +x install_migrate.sh

# 3. Run the script (administrator password may be required)
./install_migrate.sh

# 4. Verify installation
migrate -version
# Example output: v4.18.3
```

#### Option B: Homebrew (macOS only)
```bash
# 1. Install via Homebrew
brew install golang-migrate

# 2. Verify installation
migrate -version
# Example output: v4.18.3
```

### 1.4.2 Execute the Migration
```bash
# Run the migration command with the appropriate connection string
cd {deepextension_base_dir}
migrate -path migrations -database "postgres://{dbuser}:{dbpassword}@{dbhost}:{dbport}/{dbname}?sslmode=disable" up
```

### 1.4.3 Verify Migration
After running the migration, enter the database and run the following query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```
If the result is greater than 20, it indicates that the schema migration was successful and the required tables have been created.

Once the migration is successfully verified, you can proceed with the next installation steps.
If the schema is not properly initialized, the program will fail to start.

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the DeepExtension repository from GitHub.

```bash
cd /opt
git clone {deepextension_github_url} deepextension
cd deepextension
```

Check that the clone was successful and without errors.

---

## 3. Configure AI Training Image

There are three options depending on your platform:

### A. CUDA (Linux, NVIDIA GPUs)

1. In `{deepextension_base_dir}/prod.env`, find `SCP_AI_IMAGE_NAME` as {ai_image_name} `TRAINING_AI_IMAGE_VERSION` (e.g., `a1b2c3d4` as {ai_image_version})
2. Go to `{deepextension_base_dir}` and build the training image using the following command:

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t {ai_image_name}:{ai_image_version} -f deep-e-python/Dockerfile .
```

### B. Apple macOS (M1â€“M4)

#### a. Prepare the MLX code

1. Download the entire repository from https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm (tested successfully with v0.24.1)
2. Copy the `mlx_lm` directory into `{deepextension_base_dir}/deep-e-python`
3. Edit `{deepextension_base_dir}/deep-e-python/tuner/datasets.py`:

Change from:
```python
names = ("train", "valid", "test")
train = load_subset(data_path)
train, valid, test = [load_subset(data_path / f"{n}.jsonl") for n in names]
return train, valid, test
```
To:
```python
# names = ("train", "valid", "test")
train = load_subset(data_path)
# train, valid, test = [load_subset(data_path / f"{n}.jsonl") for n in names]
return train, train, None
```
4. Edit `tuner/trainer.py`:

Change from:
```python
mx.set_wired_limit(mx.metal.device_info()["max_recommended_working_set_size"])
```
To:
```python
# mx.set_wired_limit(mx.metal.device_info()["max_recommended_working_set_size"])
mx.set_wired_limit(8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
```

> This sets a memory limit of 8GB, suitable for LoRA training on a 1.5B base model with a 16GB Mac. Adjust as needed for your system.

#### b. For users with Conda installed

1. Create a new environment (e.g., for Python 3.11):
```bash
conda create -n deepe_prod python=3.11
```
2. Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate deepe_prod
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Test installation:
```bash
cd {deepextension_base_dir}/deep-e-python
python3 app.py
```

#### c. For users without Conda

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv deepe_prod
source deepe_prod/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Test installation:
```bash
python3 test_installation_with_tiny_training.py
```

#### d. Finalize with:

1. Install Node.js and NPM
2. Run:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

### C. No AI Image (no-training mode)

No action is required in this step â€” just make sure to set {WITH_AI_IMAGE} appropriately in the next configuration step.

---

## 4. Configure Database Access and Other Settings

**Create** the confuguration file `{deepextension_base_dir}/custom.conf` from template:

```
cd {deepextension_base_dir}
cp custom.conf.template custom.conf
```
Open `custom.conf` with any text editor and edit the following fields:
```
DB_HOST={dbhost}
DB_PORT={dbport}
DB_USER={dbuser}
DB_PASS={dbpassword}
DB_NAME={dbname}
SCP_GO_AI_TRAINING_HOST={localhost-ip}
SCP_GO_AI_TRAINING_PORT={localhost-ip}
UI_AI_EXPOSED_PORT={desized-webui-port}
WITH_AI_IMAGE=[true for CUDA-based installations; false otherwise]
```
- `{local_ip}` must be the actual IP address of the current machine â€” **not** `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
- `{desired_webui_port}` can be any available port (we recommend `88` or a similar number).

> ðŸ’¡ If your machineâ€™s IP address changes frequently (e.g., on laptops or systems without a static IP), you may need to update it manually in this file. For servers, itâ€™s recommended to configure a static IP to avoid connection issues.

---

## 5. Start the Application

Run:

```bash
./run_compose.sh
```

Verify that:

- All images are downloaded
- All containers start successfully

Open `http://localhost:{desized-webui-port}` to check the Web UI.

### Verify Database Initialization (First Run Only)
During the first application launch, initial data will be populated into the database.
To verify that the schema migration was successful, connect to the database and run:
```sql
select is_init from sys_version_config where deploy_version = 0.1;
```
If the result of `is_init` is `true`, it confirms that the schema was migrated successfully.

---

## 6. Root User Setup (First Run Only)

During the first launch, a root user is created automatically. The initial password is saved at:

```
{deepextension_base_dir}/adminPassword/adminPassword.txt
```

### Steps:

1. Log in with this password
2. Immediately change it
3. **Delete** the password file for security

---

## Important

- Do **not** manually modify any files or configurations without contacting the DeepExtension team.
- Always follow upgrade instructions during version updates.
