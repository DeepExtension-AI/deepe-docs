# How You Implement Own Training (MacOS)

We are currently working on this guide and collecting more real-world usage experience from users to provide a clearer, more effective walkthrough.

However, we want to emphasize that **it is technically fully possible** to implement and run your own AI training code inside DeepExtension on **MacOS**.

---

## What You Can Do Today

We recommend reviewing [How We Implemented MLX-Demo (MacOS)](implement-mlx-demo.md), which demonstrates a successful integration between DeepExtension and the `mlx_lm.lora` training interface.

If your training framework is implemented in a similar style to `mlx_lm.lora`, it can be integrated into DeepExtension with minimal adaptation.

## What Comes Next

We are actively working on:

- Testing more training frameworks on MacOS (especially MLX-based ones)
- Providing step-by-step templates and working demo scripts
- Aligning the logging and output saving logic with Mac-specific runtime constraints

Your feedback and contributions are very welcome. A little more patience from our Mac users will help us deliver a well-rounded and robust developer experience.
